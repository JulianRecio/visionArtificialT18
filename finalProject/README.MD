<h1> Before executing </h1>

- Check the pictures are loades in the correct folder
- The .txt files must not be empty! If need be, delete all of the content and run the face_rec_file_generators.py script
- Remember that pictures should be in 4:3 aspect ratio or similar, not in 'smartphone full' aspect ratio
- The main script is face_rec_from_webcam.py
- To check in a user while the video is running, press the 'c' key on the keyboard, press any key to resume the video feed
- To stop the face recognition, press the 'q' key on the keyboard
- Stopping the feed will update the attendance file, so if you wish to start over either re-run the face_rec_file_generators.py or manipulate the content from the booleans.txt file manually (the line in this file corresponds to the same file as filenames.txt)
